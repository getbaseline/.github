# Introduction

Baseline is a set of hand crafted packages, applications, tools, services and best practices designed to improve the lives of .NET developers. Born out of the frustration of writing the same. damn. code. (ðŸ¤¬) for almost every project (an IFileStore, for example), Baseline's founder decided to open source packages he developed to solve his own real life problems.

# Contributing

We're super happy and grateful to receive bug reports and feature requests however code contributions are only accepted by our core contributors. This enables us to maintain a consistent approach to the development of our products and, frankly, results in a lot less stress.

# Contact

To contact the team please open a discussion on Baseline's tracker: github.com/baseline-project/baseline-tracker/discussions.

# Looking for the Jasper Framework's Baseline package?

The Jasper Framework (created by Jeremy Miller) has a similarly named package to this project that is a grab bag of generic utilities and extensions for .NET projects. If that's what you're looking for, you can get to it here: https://github.com/JasperFx/baseline
